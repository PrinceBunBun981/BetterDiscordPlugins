# BetterDiscord Plugins
All of the public BetterDiscord plugins I've worked on.

## OwOcord
Transforms Discord strings, guild names, channel names, and sent messages to be OwO. Original script by [Ben](https://gist.github.com/Benricheson101/6a16ff2c1f1c208ac1e17e3f9571e66d#file-discord-owo-js).

## Crazy[*](#disclaimer)
Adds a context menu button to automatically send the crazy copypasta line by line as well as the ability to automatically respond to DMs or GDMs when the word "crazy" is sent.

## StayConnected
Prevents Discord from kicking you from DM or GDM calls for being alone for too long.

## DisableHangStatuses
Stops Discord from automatically setting a hang status when joining voice channels.
